#### Getting Started

The code runs on Python 3 with Tensorflow version 1 (>=1.13). To install the dependencies, run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, download the datasets manually and put them into the `datasets` folder.
- For MNIST dataset, download from <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/> and put the standalone files into `datasets/mnist`.
- For CIFAR-10 dataset, download the "CIFAR-10 binary version (suitable for C programs)" from <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html>, extract the standalone `*.bin` files and put them into `datasets/cifar-10-batches-bin`.

To test the code: 
- Run `server.py` and wait until you see `Waiting for incoming connections...` in the console output.
- Run 5 parallel instances of `client.py` on the same machine as the server. 
- You will see console outputs on both the server and clients indicating message exchanges. The code will run for a few minutes before finishing.
- After the server and clients finish, run `plot_multi_run.py` which will plot the result. This figure will look similar to the SVM(SGD) subfigures in Fig. 4 of the paper (but with higher fluctuation).

#### Code Structure

All configuration options are given in `config.py` which also explains the different setups that the code can run with.

The results are saved as CSV files in the `results` folder. 
The CSV files should be deleted before starting a new round of experiment.
Otherwise, the new results will be appended to the existing file.

Currently, the supported datasets are MNIST and CIFAR-10, and the supported models are SVM and CNN. The code can be extended to support other datasets and models too.
